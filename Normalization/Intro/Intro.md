>You can notice in the data stored that the retailoutletid and retailoutletlocation are repeating for every item available in the retail outlet store. This is an example of redundant information. Redundant information will lead to more disk space to store the data than actually required.

> ### __Data Inconsistency__
>Data inconsistency results from anything that affects data integrity. This can cause the data to be correct in one place and wrong elsewhere it is stored. This can lead to unreliable and meaningless information.
